# Kerbal Screenshots
This is a mod dedicated to capturing those pretty moments and making sure you see them every time you boot up the game. It allows one to take screenshots of the game with any key they want (default F2), at which point they will be saved to a folder where they will be visible on the loading screen.

## How to Install
Simply drag the contents of the `GameData` folder inside the .zip (ie. `KerbalScreenshots`) into the `GameData` folder inside your KSP install directory.

## How to Use
Press the key that you have bound to Kerbal Screenshot's screenshot feature (by default F1). To change the key bound to screenshotting, open the Kerbal Screenshots GUI via the toolbar and click the button labeled with "click to change". From there, press the key you'd like it to be bound to

(secret tip for the pro gamers that is in no way related to the mod: KSP actually has custom AXIS action groups that allow you to control
things like thrust limiter and deploy angle, but they aren't bound to any keys by default. i like to have custom 1 bound to - and = and
custom 2 bound to ; and ')
