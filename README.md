# Kerbal Screenshots
This is a mod dedicated to capturing those pretty moments and making sure you see them every time you boot up the game. It allows one to take screenshots of the game with any key they want (default F2), at which point they will be saved to a folder where they will be visible on the loading screen.

## How to Install
Simply drag the contents of the `GameData` folder inside the .zip (ie. `KerbalScreenshots`) into the `GameData` folder inside your KSP install directory.
